Hoisting:
----------------
When you declare variable and function in Javascript, the execution engine 
sets up a memory space for variables and functions.

-> If it is a variable it will keep that variable in momery and assign a default value called
undefined.

-> It is a function it will copy entire function and keeps in memory.

//== check the value(a=10)
//=== check the value and it's type

var a="10";
console.log(a==10)
console.log(a===10)

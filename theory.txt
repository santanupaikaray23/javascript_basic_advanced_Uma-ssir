Javascript basic advanced 1:
------------------------------
-> It is a programming language that allows us to implement complex 
feature on the pages.
HTML->it is markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web
content.
CSS->It is a language of style rules that we used to apply styling to our HTML Content.

Javascript : It is scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content.

Syntax Parser :
----------------
A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if it's grammer is valid.

Lexical Environment :
------------------------
Where something sits physically  in the code you write.

function(){
    santanu
    paikaray

}

Execution Context :
------------------------
A wrapper to help manage the code that is running 

Lexical 1
Lexical 2
Lexical 3

Name/Value pairs:
-------------------
A name which maps to a unique value(name:'santanu')

Object:
--------
A collection of these name value pairs.

Global Environmentand Global Object:
-----------------------------------------
Whenever code is running in Javascript it runs inside an execution Context.

Execution Context(Global)
--------------------------
Global Object
this

Global:
Anything outside the function is called global.
var a =12;(global)
function add(){

    var a = 1;(local)

}
add()

Hoisting:
----------------
When you declare variable and function in Javascript, the execution engine 
sets up a memory space for variables and functions.

-> If it is a variable it will keep that variable in momery and assign a default value called
undefined.

-> It is a function it will copy entire function and keeps in memory.

//== check the value(a=10)
//=== check the value and it's type

var a="10";
console.log(a==10)
console.log(a===10)

undefined
--------------
Special value in Javascript which takes up memory space

Warning :  Never ever declare a variable undefined, because it is difficult 
to find value is 'undefined' because we set it or Javascript execution engineset it up.

Javascript follow Dynamic Typing:
-----------------------------------
You don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds,
it figures out while your code running.

Strict Typing:
--------------
C# or java follows script Typing.

Premitive Types:
----------------------
Types of data that represent a single value is called Premitive data type.

1. undefined - this represent lack of existance (we should never use this)
2. null - this represent lack of existance (we can set a variable to this)
3. Boolean - true or false
4. number -  integer/floating type(decimal)
5. string -  a sequence of characters
6. Symbol - used in ES6

Anything which is not premitive is an Object in Javascript

Object
function
array
Date
RegularExpression

Functions:
-----------------

It is a block of code wrapped around flower brackets and invocated later.

function functionname(){

}

1. Regular Functions
2. Anonymous Functions
3. Immediately Invoked Functions(IIFS)

-> Function without any Name is called Anonymous function.

First Class Functions
-----------------------
- Can be Invoked
- Assign to a variable
- passed as a parameter to another variable
